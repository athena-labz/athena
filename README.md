# DigiServices

DigiServices is a Cardano-based project that aims to be a trustworthy,
reward-driven, platform for goods and service exchanges by allowing users to
create and sign digital contracts. These contracts are written in a special
format which avoids ambiguity and misinterpretation by not relying on natural
language.
